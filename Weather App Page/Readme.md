## Weather App

Weather app is a single page application which I built to get accustomed to SwiftUI and IOS development, Right now its a static page with fixed data which supports dark mode and light mode, but I plan to use an API and get live data in the app to learn more. 

While Building the app I learnt basic IOS Fundamentals, Hstacks, Vstacks, Zstacks and can't wait to dive deep into the world of IOS.
